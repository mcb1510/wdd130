                <p> Hello, welcome to my personal website. I hope you can learn a little bit more about me. I am a Computer
                    Engineering student at Brigham Young University - Idaho, with a passion for finding effective solutions 
                    to problems. I have always enjoyed figuring out how things work, how they can be fixed, and how they can
                    be improved. This is why I decided to follow my dreams, leave my country, and pursue a higher education 
                    in a field that challenges me and allows me to apply my analytical and creative skills. <br> <br>

                    My career interests lie in software development and embedded systems. I have gained experience in quality
                    assurance, testing, and debugging software as an intern at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
                    where I worked with a team of developers and engineers to deliver reliable and user-friendly applications. 
                    I have also acquired skills in object-oriented programming, C++, Python, JavaScript, ROS2, and embedded 
                    systems, and I am currently working on IA for an R2D2 robot using Nvidia Jetson Nano. My goal is to become
                    a proficient and versatile software developer who can contribute to the advancement of technology and society.
