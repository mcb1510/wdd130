      <h4>Intro</h4>
        <p>
        Hello, welcome to my personal website. I hope you can learn a little bit more about me.
        I am a Computer Engineering student at Brigham Young University - Idaho, with a passion for 
        finding effective solutions to problems. I have always enjoyed figuring out how things work, 
        how they can be fixed, and how they can be improved. This is why I decided to follow my dreams, 
        leave my country, and pursue a higher education in a field that challenges me and allows me to 
        apply my analytical and creative skills. My career interests lie in software development and
        embedded systems. I have gained experience in quality assurance, testing, and debugging software
        as an intern at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where I worked with a team of
        developers and engineers to deliver reliable and user-friendly applications. I have also acquired 
        skills in object-oriented programming, C++, Python, JavaScript, ROS2, and embedded systems, and 
        I am currently working on IA for an R2D2 robot using Nvidia Jetson Nano. My goal is to become a 
        proficient and versatile software developer who can contribute to the advancement of technology 
        and society.</p>

      <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
      <p>
        During the last years, I have acquired important skills that allow me to have a solid background in software development, embedded systems, and electric circuits. I also have been exposed to web development, FPGAs, Computer Architecture, and Quality Assurance. The following is a list of technologies, tools, and applications I have experienced working with:
        -	Programming Languages: Python | C++ | JavaScript| HTML
        -	Python is the one I feel most comfortable with because I used it for the most part of my college education. I have a solid background in:
        Programming with Functions
        Objects and Classes
        Data Structures
        Parallelism and Concurrency
        -	ROS2
        -	Digital System Design
        -	Microprocessor Based-Systems Design
        -	Verilog (FPGA design) and Basys3
        -	Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi, Nvidia Jetson Nano
        -	Vivado
        -	LoRa
        -	IntelliJ IDEA

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
      Some of the most interesting and instrumental projects I have completed are the following:
      </p>

      <h4>BinBoy videogame: </h4>
      <p>
      Along with another 2 classmates, we had to create an application or videogame with educational 
      purposes for children. We decided to build a video game about the importance of recycling using 
      pygame. We had to learn the basics of pygame and videogames physics and then use our object-oriented 
      programming knowledge to develop the game. I personally worked most of the time on the collision 
      system and platforms. Here is the link of the game’s github repository where you can check the code 
      and actually try the game: https://github.com/mcb1510/BinBoy
      </p>

      <h4>C++ User Credentials </h4>
      <p>
        The idea of the creation of this simple program was to refresh my knowledge of C++. The program 
        contains the following C++ Syntax:
        Variables
        Expressions
        Conditionals
        Loops
        Functions
        Classes
        Data structure from STL (List) The program allows an user to create and login into an account. 
        The program will then store the user's credentials in a file.  Here is the github repository link: 
        https://github.com/mcb1510/Cpp-UserAccount
